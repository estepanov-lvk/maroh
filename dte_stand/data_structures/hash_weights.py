    Class to store hash weights produced by the algorithm

    Structure:
    weights are different for each pair of source and destination node. For each such pair a dict is stored,
        which contains resulted hash weights for each edge.
    Edge is the key of this dict - it goes from "start_node" to "neighbor_node" and has index "edge_index".
        Edge index is necessary because we are considering a MultiDiGraph
        (edges can be duplicated and index is used to differentiate them)
    The value of the dict is the weight of the edge
