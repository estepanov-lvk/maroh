Rhombus topology with 4 nodes, 8 links. Flows are generated by DemandGenerator and UniformFlowGenerator.
flows40.json and flows60.json are different sets of flows, with 40% and 60% average load respectively. To use, overwrite flows.json to one of them.
Good for testing how algorithm performs on small topologies.
