Rhombus topology with 4 nodes, 8 links. Flows are generated by DemandGenerator and UniformFlowGenerator.
flows.json are flows with 40% average load. To use the ones with 60% average load, overwrite flows.json to flows60.json from rhombus directory.
Good for testing how algorithm performs on small topologies.
