Modified Abilene topology from TopologyZoo, 7 nodes and 20 links. 4 nodes removed to reduce the number of transit nodes while preserving the asymmetry of the original topology. Edges changed to links in both directions, assigned same bandwidth to all links. Flows generated by DemandGenerator and UniformFlowGenerator.
flows.json are flows with 40% average load. To use the ones with 60% average load, overwrite flows.json to flows60.json from abilene directory.
