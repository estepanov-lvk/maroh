Modified Abilene topology from TopologyZoo, 7 nodes and 20 links. 4 nodes removed to reduce the number of transit nodes while preserving the asymmetry of the original topology. Edges changed to links in both directions, assigned same bandwidth to all links. Flows generated by DemandGenerator and UniformFlowGenerator.
flows40.json and flows60.json are flows with 40% and 60% average load. To use, overwrite flows.json to one of them.
